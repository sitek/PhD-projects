# Abstracts and bios

This is a file of all the talk abstracts and bios I write for events in 2017.

They're ordered by date of presentation so ideally they're a little easier to find.

**Abstract**: Speech communication involves the complex coordination of linguistic, articulatory, and sensory
processing. Since speech is often used to communicate emotionally salient information about the
internal state of the speaker, speech production also requires the coordination of brain networks
involved in emotional processing and internal state representation. These brain networks are largely
impaired in emotional processing disorders such as major depressive disorder. Indeed, psychiatrists
often observe speech production patterns to help diagnose specific symptoms, and machine learning
algorithms are able to detect the severity of a speaker’s depression with only the acoustic features of
speech.

We sought to understand the relationship between depression, affect, and speech. Using functional
MRI, we investigated how individuals with and without depression produce implicitly emotional speech.
We found that, when producing speech with emotional content, brain regions involved in speech
production as well as medial prefrontal areas associated with emotional processing were more active.
However, depressed participants activated regions of the canonical speech network more strongly than
non-depressed participants.

Within the depressed participant group, depression severity was strongly related to activation in the
right anterior insula when producing implicitly sad speech. This region has previously been implicated in
both depression and speech processing: activation in the right insula is highly correlated with
depression symptom severity in general, and activation and connectivity patterns during speech
processing suggest it may serve as a hub between higher level cognitive processing and linguistic and
motor speech planning, particularly with respect to prosody (for review, see Oh et al. 2014).

We also examined the effective connectivity between networks while performing the speech production
task. In non-depressed participants, a seed in the amygdala (involved in both limbic processing and
internal state representations) was less correlated with bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG, including
“Broca’s area” in the left hemisphere) and anterior insulae during speech production. Depressed
participants showed even stronger anticorrelations between the amygdala and the right IFG and insula,
extending into sensorimotor cortex.

These results suggest that internal state representations, which are overactive in major depressive
disorder, must be inhibited in order to produce speech. Indeed, the right insula, which plays a crucial
role in both depression and speech processing, is uniquely situated to modulate speech production in
depression. Overall, our findings suggest a strong coupling between limbic and speech production
networks in major depressive disorder.
